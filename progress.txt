# Progress Log

## 2026-01-07: Type augmentation fix for tanstack-compat plugin

### What was done
- Made all properties in `UseQueryEntryExtensions` optional (12 properties)
- Made all properties in `UseMutationEntryExtensions` optional (7 properties)
- Updated tanstack-compat.spec.ts to use `!` assertions for optional ext properties
- Fixed mutation-store.spec.ts test that set `customProperty` on ext (needed cast to `{ ext: unknown }`)

### Why
The plugin's type augmentation was declaring required properties on the extension interfaces. Since the core library doesn't have the plugin installed, `ext: {}` didn't satisfy the interface, breaking compilation.

### Files changed
- `plugins/tanstack-compat/src/tanstack-compat.ts` - optional properties in interfaces
- `plugins/tanstack-compat/src/tanstack-compat.spec.ts` - non-null assertions
- `src/mutation-store.spec.ts` - cast for customProperty test

### Verification
- `pnpm run test:types` passes
- 15 tanstack-compat tests pass

### Next steps
Remaining PRD items:
- Run plugin tests (verification) - should pass now
- Build verification

### What was done
- Verified 15 tanstack-compat plugin tests pass
- Verified `pnpm run test:types` passes
