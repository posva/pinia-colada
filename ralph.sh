This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority - not necessarily the first in the list. \
2. Check that the types check via pnpm typecheck and that the tests pass via pnpm test. \
3. Update the PRD with the work that was done. \
4. Append your progress to the progress.txt file. \
Use this to leave a note for the next person working in the codebase. \
5. Make a git commit of that feature. \

If, while implementing the feature, you notice the PRD is complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>. \
